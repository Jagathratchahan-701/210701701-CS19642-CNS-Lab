This is a "read me" which contains aim, algorithm and result on how this project is done.
AIM:
  To implement encryption alogrithm using Caesar cipher technique.
ALGORITHM:
  Step1: Prompt the user to enter a message to encrypt using the encryption key (key).
  Step2: Iterate through each character in the text and apply the caesar cipher encryption.
  Step3: Print the encrypted message.
RESULT:
  The caesar cipher program has been successfully encrypted.
