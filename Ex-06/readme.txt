This file contains the aim, procedure and the result to implement Digital Signature Algorithm using c.
AIM :  To implement Digital Signature Algorithm using C
ALGORITHM :
  Step1: Include neccessay header files.
  Step2: Declare the neccessary variables for the program, such as integers, prime integers , private keys ,hash value and computed values like gg,rr,ss.
  Step3: Prompt the user to input prime number p, and prime divisor q of (p-1)(q-1).Also prompt the user to enter hh suchh that it's greater than 1 and less than (p-1)(q-1).
  Step4: Calculate g using the function power(h,t,p).
  Step5: Prompt the user to enter their private key x, and secret key k.Also prompt the user to enter the hash value M.
  Step6: Compute r and s values for the signature using the provided formulas.
  Step7: Print the computed values of g ,y ,r and s.
  Step8: Define the power function to calculate the power of a number modulo p.
  Step9: Define the multiplicative inverse function to find the multiplicative iverse of a number modulo n.


RESULT:
  The c rogram to implement Digital Signature Algorithm has been successfully implemented.
