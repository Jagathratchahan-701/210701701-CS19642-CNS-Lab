This file contain the aim, algorithm and results of the program to implement rail fence cipher technique.
AIM :
  To implement an encryption algorithm using rail fence cipher technique.
ALGORITHM :
  Step1: Create two strings ,one is, your message to be encrypted(say 'msg') and the other is, key used for encrytion (say 'key').
  Step2: Create railMatrix with dimensions [key][msgLen], initializing elements with newline characters.
  Step3: Iterate through msg, placing characters in railMatrix based o the railfence cipher pattern , updating row and col.
  Step4: Print the encrypted message by traversing railMatrix, excluding characters.
  Step5: return 0 for succesful execution.





RESULT:
  The railfence program has been successfully executed.
