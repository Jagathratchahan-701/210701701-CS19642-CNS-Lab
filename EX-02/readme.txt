This is a readme which consist of aim, algorithm and result to implement playfair cipher encryption algorithm.
AIM:  
  To implement an encryption algorithm using Playfair Cipher technique.
ALGORITHM:
  Step1:"ALGORITHM"(as the key) and "ulroaliocvrx"(as the encrpyted text)
  Step2: Remove spaces and convert to lowercase.
  Step3: Create a 5x5 matrix based on the modified key.
  Step4: Apply Playfair cipher decryption to the encrypted text using the generated key table.
  Step5: Display the deciphered text.







RESULT:
    The playfair cipher has been executed successfully.
